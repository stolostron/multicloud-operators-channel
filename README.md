## Overview

Channels (channel.apps.open-cluster-management.io) define the source repositories that a cluster can subscribe to with a subscription, and can be the following types: Git, Helm release, and Object storage repositories, and resource templates on the hub cluster.

See how channels are being used in the [multicloud-operators-subscription](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/multicloud-operators-subscription) project.

## Deployment

See `multicloud-operators-subscription` [stand-alone](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/multicloud-operators-subscription#stand-alone-deployment) and [multi-cluster](https://github.com/open-cluster-management-io/multicloud-operators-subscription#multi-cluster-deployment) deployments for more information.
